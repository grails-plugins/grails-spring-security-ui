ACL management should be done using the API exposed by @AclService@ and @AclUtilService@. Both services have a much more intuitive and convenient high-level approach to managing ACLs, ACEs, etc. The functionality in this plugin is to provide a CRUD interface for fine-grained ACL management.

The ACL menu is only available if the [ACL plugin|http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-acl] is installed.
