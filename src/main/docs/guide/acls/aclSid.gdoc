The default action for the AclSid controller is search. The @sid@ field has an Ajax autocomplete to assist in finding instances. Leave the sid field empty and @principal@ set to Either to return all instances.

Results are shown paginated in groups of 10. The column headers are clickable and will sort the results by that field:

h4. AclSid Edit

After clicking through to a sid you get to the edit page (there are no view pages):

You can update the name and whether it's a Principal sid or a Role sid, and delete the instance if there aren't any associated @AclObjectIdentity@ or @AclEntry@ instances - by default there is no support for cascading.

You can also see the associated @AclObjectIdentity@ instances (OIDs) or @AclEntry@ instances.

h4. AclSid Create

You can create new instances by going to @/aclSid/create@ or by clicking the @Create@ action in the @SID@ menu under @ACL@.
